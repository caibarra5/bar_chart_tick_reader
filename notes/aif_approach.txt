A decision-theoretic visual attention assistant for simulation outputs

Use case:
Multi-fidelity surrogate model outputs — multiple approximations of the same system with different accuracy–cost trade-offs.

Key design choice:
Apply Active Inference to structured summaries / metadata, not raw visuals.

1D function + multi-fidelity Gaussian Process (Kennedy–O’Hagan style)
