Context:
We want an agent (that has human capabilities) to determine the avg of two bars in a bar graph. 
We approximate human precision by a coarse bin within two tick values. 
We split data values into a tick interval and pixel height for the true states (extreme ground truth). 
We know this from an actual png file of a bar chart that we can already extract the necessary data using tesseract and OpenCV.
Observations of bar heights are low resolution while the hidden state bar heights are higher resolution (but still not 
pixel-level because we don't want our number of hidden states to be too big. Might helpe with computation time, but will
incrase after validating generative model.)
Our goal is for the agent to want to seek out more info before reporting is avg. We want intelligence to be emergent somehow.
A smart person would first estimate the bar heights (coarse view, human capability) and then report an avg.

hidden state factors(3):

fine_bin_bar1_height:
# of states: n_ticks * 15
meaning: the true height of bar 1 (pixel level) lies in one of n_ticks * 15 fine bins.
It's complement is coarse_bin_bar1_height

fine_bin_bar2_height:
# of states: n_ticks * 15
meaning: the true height of bar 2 (pixel level) lies in one of n_ticks * 15 fine bins.
It's complement is coarse_bin_bar2_height

enough_info_to_report_avg:
# of states: 4
states: (no_bar_heights_estimated, only_bar1_height_estimated, 
only_bar2_height_estimated, both_bar_heights_estimated)
these map to  (not_enough_info, partial_info, partial_info, a_lot_of_info)

attention_state:
# of states: 3
states: next_attn, prev_attn, action


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
observations modalities(3):

coarse_bin_bar1_height:
# of states: n_ticks * 5
meaning: the true height of bar 1 (hidden-state level) lies in one of n_ticks * 5 coarse bins.
This observation should collapse fine_bin_bar1_height into a truncated, distretized Gaussian.

coarse_bin_bar2_height:
# of states: n_ticks * 5
meaning: the true height of bar 1 (hidden-state level) lies in one of n_ticks * 5 coarse bins.
This observation should collapse fine_bin_bar1_height into a truncated, distretized Gaussian.

avg_feedback:
description: feedback from reporting avg
# of states: 4
states:
not_close_at_all: not even in the same tick interval
close: in the same tick interval as the fine bin the pixel-level avg lives in.
very_close: as close to the fine bin the pixel-level avg lives in as the lenght of a coarse bin or closer.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Action factor: attentional_action

States:
0 = focus_on_bar1
1 = focus_on_bar2
2 = report_avg

Reminder:
D = P(states_0) # first prior of beliefs (start of the inference cycle)
C = log P(observation) # What we want to see
B = P(state_{t+1} | state_t, u_t) # Dependency on both the previous state and action
A = P(observation_t | state_t) # What we observe now depends on the current hidden state only
