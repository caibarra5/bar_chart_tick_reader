We are basically doing plot digitizing.

Apporach to sample observations:
1. Use chatgpt api 
2. Use CNN with randomized (well samples) graphs and graph elements
3. Use VLM with randomized (well samples) graphs and graph elements
4. Plot parser + NN (maybe) 

Set beliefs to cosine similarities?
No. Relate them via the log evidens (likelihood).




1. What exists “out there” (reality check)
A. Plot / chart type classification

Goal: “What kind of plot is this?”

Research benchmarks (not libraries):

FigureQA, PlotQA, ChartOCR

Do plot-type classification and sometimes element detection

Mostly synthetic data, brittle, research code

End-to-end Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifiers

Input image → label (bar, line, scatter)

Easy to use, opaque, throw away structure

Bottom line:
Plot type classification exists mostly as research code or CNN demos, not as clean tools.

B. Plot element detection

Goal: “Where are the bars, axes, labels, ticks?”

Classical Computer Vision (CV):

OpenCV: lines, contours, shapes

Optical Character Recognition (OCR): Tesseract

Object detection models:

YOLO, Detectron2 (if trained)

Document layout tools:

PubLayNet, LayoutLM (layout, not plot semantics)

Bottom line:
Element detection is solved at a low level, but not semantically grounded.

C. Plot question answering

Goal: “What does this plot say?”

Chart Question Answering (Chart QA) research models:

PlotQA, FigureQA

Trained end-to-end

Approximate, dataset-specific

Vision–Language Models (VLMs):

Can answer qualitative questions

Human-like, uncertain, sometimes wrong

Bottom line:
No robust, general, deployable library exists for true plot understanding.

2. The three main paths you can take
Path 1 — Exact, symbolic chart parsing (machine-like)

What it is:

Detect axes, ticks, bars

Reconstruct coordinate system

Extract numeric data

Answer questions exactly

Pros:

Accurate

Explainable

Deterministic

Cons:

Engineering-heavy

Not human-like

Best if: you want correctness and data extraction.

Path 2 — Human-like heuristic understanding (bounded, approximate)

What it is:

Coarse plot type recognition

Salient element detection

Ordinal / qualitative reasoning

Uncertainty tolerated

Typical answers:

“This bar is larger”

“Trend seems negative”

“Category B dominates”

Tools:

Vision–Language Models (VLMs)

Lightweight CV + heuristics

Pros:

Fast

Flexible

Matches human behavior

Cons:

Imprecise

Occasionally wrong

Best if: you want cognitive realism, not exact measurement.

Path 3 — Hybrid (most realistic and flexible)

What it is:

Coarse plot recognition (CNN or VLM)

Conditional element detection (CV)

Heuristic or probabilistic reasoning

Pros:

Balanced

Extendable

Human-like but grounded

Cons:

Still a system you assemble

Best if: you want a believable perceptual agent.

3. Key takeaways (the “remember this” part)

There is no single library that:

identifies plot type,

recognizes elements,

and answers questions robustly.

Existing tools solve pieces, not the whole.

“Recognition” in practice = classification + inference under prior categories.

Exact chart parsing ≠ human perception.

Human-like plot understanding is:

approximate,

qualitative,

uncertain,

heuristic.

4. Practical recommendation (short)

If you want exact answers → symbolic chart parser.

If you want human-like answers → VLMs + heuristics.

If you want flexibility → hybrid pipeline.
